# Jakayla Robinson
**Space Systems Consultant | Mission Architecture & Satellite Operations**

I help satellite operators and NewSpace companies with telemetry analysis, mission planning, and constellation design.

## What I Do
- Spot momentum wheel saturation before it burns through your propellant budget
- Analyze telemetry patterns that indicate component failures weeks before they happen
- Design mission trajectories that work with actual launch vehicles, not fantasy ones
- Build constellation architectures that don't require 47 meetings to understand

## Background
- **MS Space Systems Management** - Florida Institute of Technology
- **BS Applied Physics** - University of Alabama, Birmingham  
- **STK Level 1 Certified**

## Work
🛰️ **[Satellite Attitude Dynamics](https://github.com/Jakayla-R/satellite-attitude-dynamics)** - MATLAB simulation showing what momentum wheel saturation actually looks like

📡 **[Astrodynamics MATLAB Examples](https://github.com/Jakayla-R/Astrodynamics-MATLAB-Examples)** - Sequential estimation, RTBP, rendezvous operations, genetic algorithms

## Writing
📝 **[Substack](https://substack.com/@jakaylarobinson)** - Space systems analysis and honest takes on working in aerospace
